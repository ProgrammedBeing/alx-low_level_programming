# 0x09-static_libraries Tasks

This repository contains a series of tasks related to working with static libraries in C programming. Each task is designed to help you understand the concepts of static libraries, how to create and use them, and their benefits and limitations.

## Tasks List

1. **0. A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life:**
   Create the static library `libholberton.a` containing various functions defined in separate `.c` files.

2. **1. Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future:**
   Create a script called `create_static_lib.sh` that compiles all `.c` files in the current directory and creates a static library called `liball.a`.

3. **2. Either write something worth reading or do something worth writing:**
   Write a blog post explaining the differences between static and dynamic libraries in C programming.

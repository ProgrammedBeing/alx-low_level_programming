## Description

Welcome to the C Preprocessor Repository! This repository is dedicated to exploring and learning about the C preprocessor, a crucial tool in C and C++ programming.

The C preprocessor is responsible for various text manipulations in your code before the actual compilation process. It is used for tasks like macro expansion, conditional compilation, and including header files. This repository aims to provide resources, examples, and discussions related to the C preprocessor to help you understand and use it effectively in your projects.
